# Seshd — project context for Claude Code

## What this is
Seshd is a gym/workout tracker built as a **single-file React + Vite PWA**, shipped to iOS via **Capacitor 8**. Almost all app code lives in **`src/App.jsx`** (very large — ~20,800+ lines). Treat that file as the whole app unless told otherwise.

- Repo: `github.com/moproblems49/spotr` → deploys to `spotr-drab.vercel.app` (Vercel)
- Bundle id: `com.seshd.app` · Apple Team ID: `66M7SCD5GA`
- Supabase project ref: `zwsoxvekobvtvsphesef`
- Owned domain: `getseshd.app` — used ONLY for transactional email (Resend SMTP, sender
  `hello@getseshd.app`); the app itself still lives on spotr-drab.vercel.app.
- A friend (Ashley) handles all Xcode / TestFlight / Mac-side work.

## Who I'm working with
Mo is **non-technical**. He doesn't write code. So:
- **Write all the code yourself.** Don't ask him to edit files or run complex commands.
- **Don't explain code changes unless he asks.** Lead with what changed and what he needs to do next.
- **Lead with honest tradeoffs.** If something is a bad idea, a lower priority, or can't actually work (e.g. a web app can't post directly to an Instagram story), say so plainly instead of building the wrong thing.
- Keep him moving: end each piece of work with exactly what to do next (commit/push or test on device).

## The workflow (important — follow this every time)
**One change → verify → commit.** Don't batch many speculative changes.

1. Make ONE focused change to `src/App.jsx` (or the relevant file).
2. **Verify it compiles** before moving on:
   ```
   npx esbuild src/App.jsx --bundle --packages=external --loader:.jsx=jsx --outfile=/dev/null
   ```
   (ignore the `import.meta` notice; look for real errors)
3. For logic changes, verify behavior with a quick Node/jsdom check rather than trusting a string match. Render or parse — don't grep minified data (the muscle-icon base64 and exercise maps produce false grep hits).
4. **Bump the version comment** on line 1 of `src/App.jsx` (e.g. `// v178091716487` → increment the number). This is the Vercel cache-buster — bump it on every change or the deploy may serve a stale build.
5. Commit with a clear message. Push when Mo says he's ready (he often batches the push).

Standard commit/push:
```
git add src/App.jsx
git commit -m "<clear message>"
git push
```
In remote (claude.ai) sessions the standing directive is to push every change to BOTH the
session branch AND `main` (`git push -u origin <branch> && git branch -f main HEAD && git push origin main`
— main has always been a fast-forward so far). Version-bump one-liner that avoids hand-editing:
`cur=$(head -1 src/App.jsx | grep -oE '[0-9]+'); sed -i "1s/v${cur}/v$((cur+1))/" src/App.jsx`.
DB changes: apply directly via the Supabase MCP (`apply_migration`/`execute_sql`) — verified RLS
with `SET LOCAL ROLE`/`request.jwt.claims` role-sims; direct HTTPS to supabase.co is blocked by the
sandbox network policy (use MCP, not curl). Vercel note: pushes to main DO deploy — a "404" on a
policy page turned out to be pure browser cache (incognito confirmed live), don't chase deploy ghosts.

## Verification methodology (how we catch regressions)
There are jsdom simulation scripts that mount the real app bundle and exercise flows. Before running them, rebuild the ESM bundle (stale bundle = false failures):
```
npx esbuild src/App.jsx --bundle --format=esm --loader:.jsx=jsx --jsx=automatic \
  --outfile=build/app.mjs --external:react --external:react-dom \
  --external:react-dom/client --external:react/jsx-runtime \
  --define:import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL='"https://stub.supabase.co"' \
  --define:import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY='"stubkey"' \
  --define:import.meta.env.VITE_POSTHOG_KEY='""' \
  --define:import.meta.env.DEV='false'
```
(the last two defines are required — without them the bundle throws `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'VITE_POSTHOG_KEY')` at import time and every sim fails before it even renders)
Key sims (run ONE per invocation; they take ~1–2 min): a workout-flow sim (logs sets, checks no crash), an editor sim, an auth sim, a profile/readiness sim. Each prints PASS/FAIL-style lines. Use them after any change that touches the workout, profile, feed, or swipe code.

**Harness gotcha (cost a masked failure once):** run sims from the repo's `build/` dir — NOT from an external scratch dir — so the sim and the app bundle resolve the SAME React instance (two copies = invalid-hook crash). `jsdom` is installed `--no-save`, so ANY `npm install` in the repo prunes it — reinstall with `npm install --no-save jsdom` after touching dependencies. And never gate a commit on `node sim.mjs | tail` — the pipe exit code is tail's, not the sim's; run the sim bare or check PIPESTATUS.

To write a new sim, copy the harness header from an existing one (it seeds a guest workout and a female body type), then append the specific interaction + assertions.

### Playwright visual verification (renders the REAL app — use for any UI/visual change)
jsdom sims prove behavior; Playwright proves it LOOKS right. The polish run caught 5 shipped
visual bugs this way (serif-font fallback, cover-scrim smudge, etc.) that no sim would see.
Recipe (worked examples in `build/shots.mjs` (App Store screenshots), `build/polish_tour*.mjs`):
1. Build with stub env — write `.env.local` (VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://stub.supabase.co,
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=stubkey, VITE_POSTHOG_KEY=) → `npm run build` → delete `.env.local`.
2. Serve: `cd dist && python3 -m http.server 8199 &` (it dies between long steps — re-check
   `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8199/` before each run or every shot is a Chromium error page).
3. `npm install --no-save playwright-core jsdom` — install BOTH TOGETHER; any `--no-save`
   install prunes the other one. Chromium binary: `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome`
   (launch with `executablePath` + `--no-sandbox`; never `playwright install`).
4. Seed a signed-in app via `page.addInitScript`: localStorage keys `seshd_v1` (store JSON),
   `seshd_session`, `seshd_onboarded=1`, `seshd_custom_merge_v1=1`, and optionally
   `seshd_active_session` + `seshd_wstart` for an in-progress workout.
5. Route supabase: FULFILL `/auth/v1/*` (fake token/user JSON — otherwise the app bounces to
   the welcome screen / guest banner) and ABORT `/rest/v1/*` (loadUserData fails gracefully and
   the seeded local store keeps rendering).
6. Driving gotchas: `page.setDefaultTimeout(3000)` or one bad locator hangs the whole tour;
   there are ~9 `aria-label="Close"` nodes — always filter `.locator("visible=true")`;
   the Settings sheet closes via its "Done" TEXT button, the Body screen via the "‹" Back chevron
   (generic Close/Escape do nothing — a stuck overlay makes every later shot identical);
   viewport 428×926 @ deviceScaleFactor 3 = 1284×2778 (the App Store size).

## Conventions & gotchas
- **`C` theme object** holds all colors. Inline styles everywhere — no CSS classes/files, with ONE
  exception: `src/index.css` sets the app-wide `font-family` fallback (same stack as `F`; keep them
  in sync). It exists because any element missing an inline `fontFamily` used to render in the
  WebView's default Times serif (this actually shipped on ExerciseDetail). Don't delete it.
- **Pluralize user-facing counts** (`{n} member{n===1?"":"s"}`) and **suppress zero/meaningless
  deltas** ("▲ 0% volume", "+225 over your previous best" on a first-ever PR — `hitPRs` carries a
  `firstEver` flag for this). Both classes of bug shipped once; check for them in new stat UI.
- **Wrapped story frame:** `wrapStorySVG()` strips the card's own lowercase "seshd" watermark and
  adds a single bottom "SESHD" — don't re-add a watermark to card SVGs without checking it.
- Helpers: `posNum()` (input sanitize), `LBS_PER_KG` (=2.2046), `cvt()` (unit conversion), `EXERCISE_ALIASES` (dedup), `IS_DEV` (dev-only logging).
- **Number inputs use `type="text"` + `inputMode`, never `type="number"`** — `type="number"` triggers the iOS autofill pill. Keep it this way.
- **Touch/swipe:** React's synthetic touch listeners are passive (preventDefault is a no-op). The tab swipe relies on `touch-action: pan-y` on the root container. **Never swap the DOM structure mid-gesture** — that orphans the touch on iOS and freezes the drag (this broke the co-move twice). The current co-move uses a stable 3-panel track `[prev|current|next]` where the center (touched) node never unmounts.
- **Gesture perf pattern (house style — follow this for any NEW drag/swipe code):** don't call `setState` on every `touchmove`/`mousemove` frame, it re-renders the whole screen per frame. Instead: call `setState` exactly once on the first frame that crosses a real threshold (flips the CSS `transition` off via a render and mounts/reveals anything needed), then every later frame writes directly to a ref'd DOM node's `.style` (transform/opacity/height/etc), then on gesture end read the **live ref value** (not the possibly-stale state var) to decide the outcome and commit it back via one final `setState`. Used in `PullToRefresh`, `SetRow`, `StoryViewer`, `InsightCards`, `ProfileScreen`'s cover-drag, and the feed/tab-swipe in `AppInner`. Two traps this pattern has actually hit: (1) if the final reset `setState` value is ever equal (via `Object.is`) to the last value React already committed, React skips the DOM write and a directly-ref-written style gets stuck — make sure the first-frame commit is always meaningfully non-rest so the final reset always differs (see `StoryViewer`'s `settleBack()` helper for the case where it doesn't); (2) **mouse drags need `window`-level `mousemove`/`mouseup` listeners, not element-level ones** — `onMouseMove`/`onMouseUp` JSX props only fire while the cursor is physically over that element, so a drag that exits a small drop target before the button is released would silently freeze state at the first frame (this happened to the cover-photo drag; fixed by adding/removing `window.addEventListener` pairs in the start/end handlers instead).
- **State is stale inside touch handlers / setTimeout.** Use refs (`useRef`) as the source of truth for values read inside `onTouchEnd` etc.
- **Hooks must stay above the component's early returns** (`if (profileUserId) return ...`, etc.) or you get "rendered more hooks than previous render".
- **Windows CRLF** can make git report "nothing to commit" even when the file changed.
- **Body maps** (`BODYMAP_MALE`, `BODYMAP_FEMALE`): minified JSON path data. Always `JSON.parse` to inspect — never grep. Female map regions must scale uniformly to preserve anatomy.
- **Two post tables:** `posts` (main personal feed + stories, `type:"story"` <24h = story ring) and `group_posts` (group feed). Don't confuse them.
- Destructive confirms use the in-app `confirmAction({...})` / `ConfirmHost` sheet — **never `window.confirm`** (ugly on iOS).
- Memory/safety: never reduce the app's own safety behavior; this is a consumer fitness app.

## Current state / roadmap (as of last session)
Recently shipped & verified (newest first): **Polish run** (5 Playwright-verified visual fixes:
global sans fallback in index.css; profile cover scrim only over a real photo; PR modal `firstEver`
handling; zero-delta "▲ 0%" suppressed in Wrapped modal + wrapped PostCard + shared SVG;
"1 member" pluralization ×4 sites). **Story delete** — trash button in StoryViewer for your own
story (`post.userId === currentUserId`), confirmAction sheet, reuses `handleDelete` (stories are
`posts` rows); sim: `sim_storydel.mjs`. **Auth-screen logo** — big centered `<SeshdLogo size={72}/>`
above "Welcome back" (SeshdLogo now takes a `size` prop). **Wrapped story double-wordmark fix**
(see Conventions). **App Store submission assets — ALL ENTERED in App Store Connect by Mo:**
listing copy (subtitle/description/keywords/promo), screenshots uploaded, Support URL set.
Assets live in the repo: `appstore-screenshots/captioned/` (upload-ready, lifter-voice headlines)
+ `plain/` — both **1284×2778** (the 6.5" slot REJECTED 1290×2796; 1284×2778 is accepted in both
slots); `appstore-submission.md` (App Review notes + TestFlight what-to-test, paste-ready);
`public/support.html` + `terms.html` + `privacy.html` all live (a "404" was browser cache).
**App Review demo accounts (live in prod DB):** `appreview@getseshd.app` / `SeshdDemo2026`
(follows Coach Kai so the feed + Report/Block are testable) and buddy `coachkai@getseshd.app`
(same pw, has one post) — created via SQL insert into auth.users (token columns need explicit
empty strings, profile auto-created by `handle_new_user` trigger). Mo still needs to sign in once
to verify the login before submitting. Mo is added as an internal TestFlight tester. DMARC is the
one remaining optional Mo-side item. Earlier: **App Store trust & safety pass** — three things a
UGC app needs for Guideline 1.2 review: (1) **Report flow** — module-level `reportContent(target)`
+ `<ReportHost>` (mirrors `confirmAction`/`ConfirmHost`; rendered next to ConfirmHost in AppInner
so it needs `token`+`currentUserId` props), wired into profiles (the old standalone Block button
is now a `···` overflow with Report+Block), personal feed posts (PostCard's non-own `···`), group
posts (non-`isMyPost` `···`), and DM headers. Writes to the **insert-only `reports` table**
(RLS: insert only as yourself via `reporter_id = auth.uid()`, NO select policy → clients can never
read reports; **Mo triages in the Supabase dashboard `reports` table — Apple wants action within
24h**). (2) **Terms/EULA agreement at sign-up** — signup mode shows "By creating an account you
agree to Terms + Privacy, including a zero-tolerance policy for objectionable content and abusive
behavior" linking `spotr-drab.vercel.app/terms.html` (new — `public/terms.html`, matches
privacy.html style) + `/privacy.html`. (3) **Private group photos** — group photos are members-only
now, NOT in the public `images` bucket: `uploadGroupImage()` posts to the private **`group-images`**
bucket under a `{groupId}/` folder and stores the bare PATH in `group_posts.image_url`;
`signGroupImage()` mints a 1h signed URL to view; RLS helper `group_image_member_check()`
(SECURITY DEFINER) gates BOTH insert and select on group membership, so non-members 403 on signing.
`GroupDetail` signs paths lazily into `signedImgs` state (only successes cached, so transient sign
failures retry) and `resolveImg(post)` picks _localImage → signed path → legacy absolute URL.
Signed-URL shareability (a copied link works ≤1h) is the accepted tradeoff — same model Instagram
uses. Verified: RLS role-sims (member sees / outsider 403), `sim_report.mjs`, `sim_offline.mjs`.
NOTE on **offline-first**: it was ALREADY robust and is now proven — `queueWrite`/`flushWriteQueue`
(durable localStorage PATCH/DELETE queue, merges, flushed on boot AND reconnect) + the
`seshd_pending_workouts` queue for the workout POST (idempotent upsert on client `id` via
`on_conflict=id`, retried on boot+reconnect). Only offline likes/comments (POSTs) are best-effort.
Also recently: **password-reset flow** (Forgot password? on sign-in
→ Resend email → `#type=recovery` landing forces a set-new-password screen; sim: `sim_reset.mjs`);
**Resend SMTP live** on `getseshd.app` (sender `hello@getseshd.app` — the sender address MUST be
at the verified domain, a placeholder domain 550s; check Supabase auth logs via MCP `get_logs`
service `auth` when email "silently" fails, the reset UI intentionally never surfaces errors);
password minimum is **8 chars** (Supabase setting + sign-up validation — keep in sync);
**login blip fix** (loadUserData retries once silently before the "check connection" toast;
ToastHost now seeds from the queue so pre-mount toasts aren't swallowed); **iOS 18 AutoFill fix
v2** (the 4 keypad set fields are DIVs now — any focused real input attracts the pill, readOnly
included; keep them divs); **core secondary credits** (32 compounds → Abs/Obliques half-credit;
back squat/deadlift deliberately excluded — bracing ≠ half a set of abs); **AI form-guide button
removed** (all 292 built-in exercises have hand-written cues/mistakes/breathe in exerciseCues.js
— audited for duplicates/equipment-mismatch/generic filler, quality confirmed; custom exercises
get the generic fallback); **one-time custom-exercise merge migration** (`CUSTOM_MERGE_MAP_V1` +
batched `mergeExerciseNames()` — single-pair loops corrupt sessions holding two renamed
exercises, always batch; flag `seshd_custom_merge_v1`); **bug-sweep fixes** (border shorthand +
borderLeft in ONE style object breaks React's style diffing when either side is dynamic — use
per-side borders; guest auth-gate Back now returns to the app, not the marketing screen); plus
the earlier era: co-move swipe, Wrapped share-to-story, block users, native confirm sheets,
female body map, and the full security/perf audit (RLS gaps, webhook auth, race conditions).

**Sim battery (build/*.mjs, all currently passing):** `sim_sweep.mjs` (full-app fuzz tour, run
plain AND with `guest` arg), `sim_flows.mjs` (finish-workout → recap + kg-unit smell scan),
`sim_reset.mjs` (password reset both halves), `sim_retry.mjs` (login blip/persistent failure),
`sim_merge.mjs` (custom-name migration), `sim_keypad.mjs` (div set fields + NumberPad),
`sim_howto.mjs` (exercise-detail guides, no AI button), `sim_report.mjs` (foreign feed post →
`···` → Report → reason → asserts POST to `reports`; needs the post author followed + Home tab —
the feed only shows followed users and boots to the tracker, not the feed), `sim_offline.mjs`
(finish workout while the save throws → lands in `seshd_pending_workouts` → fire window
offline→online → asserts idempotent `on_conflict=id` upsert + queue drains), `sim_storydel.mjs`
(seed an own `type:"story"` post → open "Your story" ring → trash button → confirm → asserts
DELETE to `posts?id=eq.<id>`; delete button is gated on `post.userId===currentUserId`), plus the older
sim_tap/str/vol/msg/
weekly/bb/hist/keychain/empty/gestures set. Sweep gotchas: nav buttons are aria-label-only
(match both), NumberPad keys fire on pointerdown not click, NumberPad portals to document.body,
and closePad arms a 500ms ghost-click swallower (wait it out before the next click).
**Stale-stub trap (bit sim_msg once):** the app loads OTHER users from `public_profiles`, not
`profiles` — any sim whose fetch stub only answers `/rest/v1/profiles` renders an empty social
UI and fails on "missing" friends. When a sim fails after a data-path change, suspect the sim's
stub before the app.

**Gesture-perf refactor (merged to main):** every touch/drag gesture in the app — `SetRow` swipe, tab-swipe, the shared `PullToRefresh` component (History/Profile/Messages), the feed's own pull-to-refresh, `StoryViewer` drag, `InsightCards` swipe, and the profile cover-photo position drag — was re-pointed from per-frame `setState` (re-rendering the whole screen on every `touchmove`) to the ref-write pattern documented above, plus a fix for vertical-scroll bleed-through during the tab swipe. A code review of this refactor caught and fixed one real regression before merge: the cover-photo drag's mouse path could freeze `coverPosDraft` at the gesture's first frame if the cursor left the small drag area before mouseup (now uses `window`-level listeners — see the Conventions note above).

**Push notifications are now fully wired end-to-end on the code/server side** — client registers for APNs, saves the token, and routes a tapped notification to the right screen (DM → chat thread, follow → profile, kudos/comment → Activity tab, streak → Tracker tab). Server-side: all 4 DB webhooks (`messages`, `kudos`, `comments`, `follows` → `send-message-push`/`send-activity-push`) and the `streak-at-risk-push` weekly pg_cron job are configured and active, confirmed sending real 200s in the edge function logs. **The only remaining blocker is Mac/Xcode-side — see the Ashley checklist below.**

Not yet done / launch-blockers: Apple Sign In is required by the App Store if any social login ships (`OAUTH_ENABLED = { apple:false, google:false }`; the Sign in with Apple capability is already ticked on the App ID). Email confirmation is still OFF — SMTP is live now, flip "Confirm email" in Supabase Auth around public launch, not before TestFlight. Reset emails land in spam while the domain is new — consider a DMARC record (`_dmarc.getseshd.app` TXT `v=DMARC1; p=none;`) and a "Seshd" sender name in Supabase SMTP settings. Native Live Activity rest timer + home-screen widgets are Mac-side (App Groups capability already ticked for them). Share-to-Instagram-Stories directly would need a native Capacitor plugin (Mac-side).

### MAC DAY — the complete checklist (Mac access expected ~July 12, 2026)
Everything that needs a Mac, in the order to do it. Code/server side is DONE for all of these.

**Step 0a — set the last APNs secret (the `.p8` key file LIVES ON THE MAC):**
The APNs key was already created in a prior session and all other secrets are already set
(`APNS_KEY_ID`, `APNS_TEAM_ID`, `APNS_TOPIC`, `APNS_ENV=production`). The one missing piece
is `APNS_PRIVATE_KEY`, blocked because the downloaded `.p8` file is on the Mac. On Mac day:
find the `.p8`, open it in TextEdit, and paste its full contents (BEGIN/END lines included)
into Supabase dashboard → Edge Functions → Secrets → `APNS_PRIVATE_KEY`. Do NOT generate a
new key in the Apple portal unless the file truly can't be found — a new key means updating
`APNS_KEY_ID` too. Pushes cannot send 200s from APNs until this secret is set.

**Step 0b — sync the native project (CRITICAL, do before any build):**
```
git pull
npm install
npx cap sync ios
```
This installs the plugins added while Mac-less: `@capacitor/preferences` (localStorage→native
persistence mirror — without it iOS can silently wipe user data), `@capgo/capacitor-health`
(ALL HealthKit reads: HRV/RHR/sleep/steps for readiness + body battery),
`@capawesome/capacitor-badge` (app-icon unread badge), and `capacitor-secure-storage-plugin`
(auth session tokens in the iOS Keychain — boot migration moves existing sessions out of
localStorage/Preferences automatically). The JS already calls all four behind guards; they
no-op until this sync runs. Nothing works health/persistence-wise without this step.

**Step 1 — Xcode capabilities (target → Signing & Capabilities → +):**
- **Push Notifications**
- **Background Modes** → check *Remote notifications*
- **HealthKit** (required for the health plugin; no background delivery needed)
- **Associated Domains** → add `applinks:spotr-drab.vercel.app` (universal links — the
  AASA file is already live at /.well-known/ and AppDelegate already handles the callback;
  only this entitlement is missing)
- (Only if/when social login ships: **Sign in with Apple**)

**Step 2 — Launch screen:** LaunchScreen.storyboard → background `#0a0a0a`, centered logo
(source art in `assets/`; `npx @capacitor/assets generate` can regenerate icons/splash from
`assets/icon-only.png` + `assets/splash*.png` if preferred). Info.plist permission strings,
portrait lock, and the app icon are already committed — no Xcode work needed for those.

**Step 3 — device test (physical iPhone; simulator can't do APNs or HealthKit):**
1. Build to device. Open app → accept push prompt → check `profiles.push_token` fills in.
2. From a 2nd account: send a DM → push arrives with the sender's name, app icon shows an
   unread badge count, tapping opens the right chat, badge clears when the app foregrounds.
   (For a direct Xcode debug build set `APNS_ENV=sandbox` in Supabase secrets; TestFlight
   uses `production`.)
3. Connect Apple Health when prompted (readiness/body battery should switch from estimated
   to real HRV/sleep within a day of data).
4. Paste a `spotr-drab.vercel.app/u/...` profile link into Notes/iMessage and tap it — it
   should open IN the app (universal link), not Safari.
5. Kill + relaunch the app — workout history must survive (Preferences persistence mirror)
   AND you must still be signed in (session now lives in the iOS Keychain).
6. If pushes fail: Supabase Edge Function logs → 401 = `WEBHOOK_SECRET` mismatch; an
   `api.push.apple.com` error = APNs key/entitlement pairing wrong.

**Step 4 — TestFlight:** archive, upload, add Mo as internal tester.

**Deferred Mac-side (post-TestFlight):** Live Activity rest timer, home-screen widgets,
share-to-Instagram-Stories plugin, converting the top bar to a true scroll-under glass
overlay (marked TODO(device-test) in App.jsx), iOS 18 light/dark icon variants (light art exists at `assets/AppIcon-1024-light.png`,
decision was to stay single dark icon).

**Mo: PC-side prerequisites (do BEFORE Mac day so Ashley isn't blocked)**
1. ~~APNs key~~ — DONE in a prior session. The `.p8` file is on the Mac; setting the
   `APNS_PRIVATE_KEY` secret from it is Step 0a of Mac day above. All other APNS_* secrets
   are already set. (Claude can't set secrets — no tool for it, and pasting the key into
   chat would expose it.)
2. ~~App Store Connect~~ — DONE (July 4). App record "Seshd — Gym Log & Lift Tracker",
   bundle id `com.seshd.app` verified, category Health & Fitness + Social Networking,
   age rating 4+, privacy questionnaire published with 8 data types, App ID capabilities
   ticked (Push, HealthKit, Associated Domains, Sign in with Apple, App Groups,
   Communication Notifications), `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false` in Info.plist.
   ~~Screenshots/description~~ — DONE (July 11): listing copy entered, screenshots uploaded,
   Support URL set, App Review notes + demo account ready in `appstore-submission.md`.
3. ~~Resend SMTP~~ — DONE (July 4): domain `getseshd.app` verified, sender
   `hello@getseshd.app`, Supabase custom SMTP active (email rate limit 30/h).
   Still Mo-side later: "Confirm email" toggle at public launch; DMARC record for
   deliverability; Apple Services ID if Google/Apple sign-in ships at launch.

## Environment notes
- Dev machine: Windows + PowerShell, Node v24.15.0. Local repo `C:\Users\mohag\spotr`.
- Don't assume libraries are installed — check `package.json`. `@dnd-kit` is used (drag-drop reorder).
