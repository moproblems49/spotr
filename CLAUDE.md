# Seshd — project context for Claude Code

## What this is
Seshd is a gym/workout tracker built as a **single-file React + Vite PWA**, shipped to iOS via **Capacitor 8**. Almost all app code lives in **`src/App.jsx`** (very large — ~18,500+ lines). Treat that file as the whole app unless told otherwise.

- Repo: `github.com/moproblems49/spotr` → deploys to `spotr-drab.vercel.app` (Vercel)
- Bundle id: `com.seshd.app` · Apple Team ID: `66M7SCD5GA`
- Supabase project ref: `zwsoxvekobvtvsphesef`
- Owned domain: `getseshd.app` — used ONLY for transactional email (Resend SMTP, sender
  `hello@getseshd.app`); the app itself still lives on spotr-drab.vercel.app.
- A friend (Ashley) handles all Xcode / TestFlight / Mac-side work.

## Who I'm working with
Mo is **non-technical**. He doesn't write code. So:
- **Write all the code yourself.** Don't ask him to edit files or run complex commands.
- **Don't explain code changes unless he asks.** Lead with what changed and what he needs to do next.
- **Lead with honest tradeoffs.** If something is a bad idea, a lower priority, or can't actually work (e.g. a web app can't post directly to an Instagram story), say so plainly instead of building the wrong thing.
- Keep him moving: end each piece of work with exactly what to do next (commit/push or test on device).

## The workflow (important — follow this every time)
**One change → verify → commit.** Don't batch many speculative changes.

1. Make ONE focused change to `src/App.jsx` (or the relevant file).
2. **Verify it compiles** before moving on:
   ```
   npx esbuild src/App.jsx --bundle --packages=external --loader:.jsx=jsx --outfile=/dev/null
   ```
   (ignore the `import.meta` notice; look for real errors)
3. For logic changes, verify behavior with a quick Node/jsdom check rather than trusting a string match. Render or parse — don't grep minified data (the muscle-icon base64 and exercise maps produce false grep hits).
4. **Bump the version comment** on line 1 of `src/App.jsx` (e.g. `// v178091716487` → increment the number). This is the Vercel cache-buster — bump it on every change or the deploy may serve a stale build.
5. Commit with a clear message. Push when Mo says he's ready (he often batches the push).

Standard commit/push:
```
git add src/App.jsx
git commit -m "<clear message>"
git push
```
Then, if any DB change was needed, tell Mo to run the SQL in the Supabase SQL editor.

## Verification methodology (how we catch regressions)
There are jsdom simulation scripts that mount the real app bundle and exercise flows. Before running them, rebuild the ESM bundle (stale bundle = false failures):
```
npx esbuild src/App.jsx --bundle --format=esm --loader:.jsx=jsx --jsx=automatic \
  --outfile=build/app.mjs --external:react --external:react-dom \
  --external:react-dom/client --external:react/jsx-runtime \
  --define:import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL='"https://stub.supabase.co"' \
  --define:import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY='"stubkey"' \
  --define:import.meta.env.VITE_POSTHOG_KEY='""' \
  --define:import.meta.env.DEV='false'
```
(the last two defines are required — without them the bundle throws `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'VITE_POSTHOG_KEY')` at import time and every sim fails before it even renders)
Key sims (run ONE per invocation; they take ~1–2 min): a workout-flow sim (logs sets, checks no crash), an editor sim, an auth sim, a profile/readiness sim. Each prints PASS/FAIL-style lines. Use them after any change that touches the workout, profile, feed, or swipe code.

**Harness gotcha (cost a masked failure once):** run sims from the repo's `build/` dir — NOT from an external scratch dir — so the sim and the app bundle resolve the SAME React instance (two copies = invalid-hook crash). `jsdom` is installed `--no-save`, so ANY `npm install` in the repo prunes it — reinstall with `npm install --no-save jsdom` after touching dependencies. And never gate a commit on `node sim.mjs | tail` — the pipe exit code is tail's, not the sim's; run the sim bare or check PIPESTATUS.

To write a new sim, copy the harness header from an existing one (it seeds a guest workout and a female body type), then append the specific interaction + assertions.

## Conventions & gotchas
- **`C` theme object** holds all colors. Inline styles everywhere — no CSS classes/files.
- Helpers: `posNum()` (input sanitize), `LBS_PER_KG` (=2.2046), `cvt()` (unit conversion), `EXERCISE_ALIASES` (dedup), `IS_DEV` (dev-only logging).
- **Number inputs use `type="text"` + `inputMode`, never `type="number"`** — `type="number"` triggers the iOS autofill pill. Keep it this way.
- **Touch/swipe:** React's synthetic touch listeners are passive (preventDefault is a no-op). The tab swipe relies on `touch-action: pan-y` on the root container. **Never swap the DOM structure mid-gesture** — that orphans the touch on iOS and freezes the drag (this broke the co-move twice). The current co-move uses a stable 3-panel track `[prev|current|next]` where the center (touched) node never unmounts.
- **Gesture perf pattern (house style — follow this for any NEW drag/swipe code):** don't call `setState` on every `touchmove`/`mousemove` frame, it re-renders the whole screen per frame. Instead: call `setState` exactly once on the first frame that crosses a real threshold (flips the CSS `transition` off via a render and mounts/reveals anything needed), then every later frame writes directly to a ref'd DOM node's `.style` (transform/opacity/height/etc), then on gesture end read the **live ref value** (not the possibly-stale state var) to decide the outcome and commit it back via one final `setState`. Used in `PullToRefresh`, `SetRow`, `StoryViewer`, `InsightCards`, `ProfileScreen`'s cover-drag, and the feed/tab-swipe in `AppInner`. Two traps this pattern has actually hit: (1) if the final reset `setState` value is ever equal (via `Object.is`) to the last value React already committed, React skips the DOM write and a directly-ref-written style gets stuck — make sure the first-frame commit is always meaningfully non-rest so the final reset always differs (see `StoryViewer`'s `settleBack()` helper for the case where it doesn't); (2) **mouse drags need `window`-level `mousemove`/`mouseup` listeners, not element-level ones** — `onMouseMove`/`onMouseUp` JSX props only fire while the cursor is physically over that element, so a drag that exits a small drop target before the button is released would silently freeze state at the first frame (this happened to the cover-photo drag; fixed by adding/removing `window.addEventListener` pairs in the start/end handlers instead).
- **State is stale inside touch handlers / setTimeout.** Use refs (`useRef`) as the source of truth for values read inside `onTouchEnd` etc.
- **Hooks must stay above the component's early returns** (`if (profileUserId) return ...`, etc.) or you get "rendered more hooks than previous render".
- **Windows CRLF** can make git report "nothing to commit" even when the file changed.
- **Body maps** (`BODYMAP_MALE`, `BODYMAP_FEMALE`): minified JSON path data. Always `JSON.parse` to inspect — never grep. Female map regions must scale uniformly to preserve anatomy.
- **Two post tables:** `posts` (main personal feed + stories, `type:"story"` <24h = story ring) and `group_posts` (group feed). Don't confuse them.
- Destructive confirms use the in-app `confirmAction({...})` / `ConfirmHost` sheet — **never `window.confirm`** (ugly on iOS).
- Memory/safety: never reduce the app's own safety behavior; this is a consumer fitness app.

## Current state / roadmap (as of last session)
Recently shipped & verified (newest first): **password-reset flow** (Forgot password? on sign-in
→ Resend email → `#type=recovery` landing forces a set-new-password screen; sim: `sim_reset.mjs`);
**Resend SMTP live** on `getseshd.app` (sender `hello@getseshd.app` — the sender address MUST be
at the verified domain, a placeholder domain 550s; check Supabase auth logs via MCP `get_logs`
service `auth` when email "silently" fails, the reset UI intentionally never surfaces errors);
password minimum is **8 chars** (Supabase setting + sign-up validation — keep in sync);
**login blip fix** (loadUserData retries once silently before the "check connection" toast;
ToastHost now seeds from the queue so pre-mount toasts aren't swallowed); **iOS 18 AutoFill fix
v2** (the 4 keypad set fields are DIVs now — any focused real input attracts the pill, readOnly
included; keep them divs); **core secondary credits** (32 compounds → Abs/Obliques half-credit;
back squat/deadlift deliberately excluded — bracing ≠ half a set of abs); **AI form-guide button
removed** (all 292 built-in exercises have hand-written cues/mistakes/breathe in exerciseCues.js
— audited for duplicates/equipment-mismatch/generic filler, quality confirmed; custom exercises
get the generic fallback); **one-time custom-exercise merge migration** (`CUSTOM_MERGE_MAP_V1` +
batched `mergeExerciseNames()` — single-pair loops corrupt sessions holding two renamed
exercises, always batch; flag `seshd_custom_merge_v1`); **bug-sweep fixes** (border shorthand +
borderLeft in ONE style object breaks React's style diffing when either side is dynamic — use
per-side borders; guest auth-gate Back now returns to the app, not the marketing screen); plus
the earlier era: co-move swipe, Wrapped share-to-story, block users, native confirm sheets,
female body map, and the full security/perf audit (RLS gaps, webhook auth, race conditions).

**Sim battery (build/*.mjs, all currently passing):** `sim_sweep.mjs` (full-app fuzz tour, run
plain AND with `guest` arg), `sim_flows.mjs` (finish-workout → recap + kg-unit smell scan),
`sim_reset.mjs` (password reset both halves), `sim_retry.mjs` (login blip/persistent failure),
`sim_merge.mjs` (custom-name migration), `sim_keypad.mjs` (div set fields + NumberPad),
`sim_howto.mjs` (exercise-detail guides, no AI button), plus the older sim_tap/str/vol/msg/
weekly/bb/hist/keychain/empty/gestures set. Sweep gotchas: nav buttons are aria-label-only
(match both), NumberPad keys fire on pointerdown not click, NumberPad portals to document.body,
and closePad arms a 500ms ghost-click swallower (wait it out before the next click).

**Gesture-perf refactor (merged to main):** every touch/drag gesture in the app — `SetRow` swipe, tab-swipe, the shared `PullToRefresh` component (History/Profile/Messages), the feed's own pull-to-refresh, `StoryViewer` drag, `InsightCards` swipe, and the profile cover-photo position drag — was re-pointed from per-frame `setState` (re-rendering the whole screen on every `touchmove`) to the ref-write pattern documented above, plus a fix for vertical-scroll bleed-through during the tab swipe. A code review of this refactor caught and fixed one real regression before merge: the cover-photo drag's mouse path could freeze `coverPosDraft` at the gesture's first frame if the cursor left the small drag area before mouseup (now uses `window`-level listeners — see the Conventions note above).

**Push notifications are now fully wired end-to-end on the code/server side** — client registers for APNs, saves the token, and routes a tapped notification to the right screen (DM → chat thread, follow → profile, kudos/comment → Activity tab, streak → Tracker tab). Server-side: all 4 DB webhooks (`messages`, `kudos`, `comments`, `follows` → `send-message-push`/`send-activity-push`) and the `streak-at-risk-push` weekly pg_cron job are configured and active, confirmed sending real 200s in the edge function logs. **The only remaining blocker is Mac/Xcode-side — see the Ashley checklist below.**

Not yet done / launch-blockers: Apple Sign In is required by the App Store if any social login ships (`OAUTH_ENABLED = { apple:false, google:false }`; the Sign in with Apple capability is already ticked on the App ID). Email confirmation is still OFF — SMTP is live now, flip "Confirm email" in Supabase Auth around public launch, not before TestFlight. Reset emails land in spam while the domain is new — consider a DMARC record (`_dmarc.getseshd.app` TXT `v=DMARC1; p=none;`) and a "Seshd" sender name in Supabase SMTP settings. Native Live Activity rest timer + home-screen widgets are Mac-side (App Groups capability already ticked for them). Share-to-Instagram-Stories directly would need a native Capacitor plugin (Mac-side).

### MAC DAY — the complete checklist (Mac access expected ~July 12, 2026)
Everything that needs a Mac, in the order to do it. Code/server side is DONE for all of these.

**Step 0a — set the last APNs secret (the `.p8` key file LIVES ON THE MAC):**
The APNs key was already created in a prior session and all other secrets are already set
(`APNS_KEY_ID`, `APNS_TEAM_ID`, `APNS_TOPIC`, `APNS_ENV=production`). The one missing piece
is `APNS_PRIVATE_KEY`, blocked because the downloaded `.p8` file is on the Mac. On Mac day:
find the `.p8`, open it in TextEdit, and paste its full contents (BEGIN/END lines included)
into Supabase dashboard → Edge Functions → Secrets → `APNS_PRIVATE_KEY`. Do NOT generate a
new key in the Apple portal unless the file truly can't be found — a new key means updating
`APNS_KEY_ID` too. Pushes cannot send 200s from APNs until this secret is set.

**Step 0b — sync the native project (CRITICAL, do before any build):**
```
git pull
npm install
npx cap sync ios
```
This installs the plugins added while Mac-less: `@capacitor/preferences` (localStorage→native
persistence mirror — without it iOS can silently wipe user data), `@capgo/capacitor-health`
(ALL HealthKit reads: HRV/RHR/sleep/steps for readiness + body battery),
`@capawesome/capacitor-badge` (app-icon unread badge), and `capacitor-secure-storage-plugin`
(auth session tokens in the iOS Keychain — boot migration moves existing sessions out of
localStorage/Preferences automatically). The JS already calls all four behind guards; they
no-op until this sync runs. Nothing works health/persistence-wise without this step.

**Step 1 — Xcode capabilities (target → Signing & Capabilities → +):**
- **Push Notifications**
- **Background Modes** → check *Remote notifications*
- **HealthKit** (required for the health plugin; no background delivery needed)
- **Associated Domains** → add `applinks:spotr-drab.vercel.app` (universal links — the
  AASA file is already live at /.well-known/ and AppDelegate already handles the callback;
  only this entitlement is missing)
- (Only if/when social login ships: **Sign in with Apple**)

**Step 2 — Launch screen:** LaunchScreen.storyboard → background `#0a0a0a`, centered logo
(source art in `assets/`; `npx @capacitor/assets generate` can regenerate icons/splash from
`assets/icon-only.png` + `assets/splash*.png` if preferred). Info.plist permission strings,
portrait lock, and the app icon are already committed — no Xcode work needed for those.

**Step 3 — device test (physical iPhone; simulator can't do APNs or HealthKit):**
1. Build to device. Open app → accept push prompt → check `profiles.push_token` fills in.
2. From a 2nd account: send a DM → push arrives with the sender's name, app icon shows an
   unread badge count, tapping opens the right chat, badge clears when the app foregrounds.
   (For a direct Xcode debug build set `APNS_ENV=sandbox` in Supabase secrets; TestFlight
   uses `production`.)
3. Connect Apple Health when prompted (readiness/body battery should switch from estimated
   to real HRV/sleep within a day of data).
4. Paste a `spotr-drab.vercel.app/u/...` profile link into Notes/iMessage and tap it — it
   should open IN the app (universal link), not Safari.
5. Kill + relaunch the app — workout history must survive (Preferences persistence mirror)
   AND you must still be signed in (session now lives in the iOS Keychain).
6. If pushes fail: Supabase Edge Function logs → 401 = `WEBHOOK_SECRET` mismatch; an
   `api.push.apple.com` error = APNs key/entitlement pairing wrong.

**Step 4 — TestFlight:** archive, upload, add Mo as internal tester.

**Deferred Mac-side (post-TestFlight):** Live Activity rest timer, home-screen widgets,
share-to-Instagram-Stories plugin, converting the top bar to a true scroll-under glass
overlay (marked TODO(device-test) in App.jsx), iOS 18 light/dark icon variants (light art exists at `assets/AppIcon-1024-light.png`,
decision was to stay single dark icon).

**Mo: PC-side prerequisites (do BEFORE Mac day so Ashley isn't blocked)**
1. ~~APNs key~~ — DONE in a prior session. The `.p8` file is on the Mac; setting the
   `APNS_PRIVATE_KEY` secret from it is Step 0a of Mac day above. All other APNS_* secrets
   are already set. (Claude can't set secrets — no tool for it, and pasting the key into
   chat would expose it.)
2. ~~App Store Connect~~ — DONE (July 4). App record "Seshd — Gym Log & Lift Tracker",
   bundle id `com.seshd.app` verified, category Health & Fitness + Social Networking,
   age rating 4+, privacy questionnaire published with 8 data types, App ID capabilities
   ticked (Push, HealthKit, Associated Domains, Sign in with Apple, App Groups,
   Communication Notifications), `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false` in Info.plist.
   Only screenshots/description remain — at TestFlight time (copy already drafted in chat).
3. ~~Resend SMTP~~ — DONE (July 4): domain `getseshd.app` verified, sender
   `hello@getseshd.app`, Supabase custom SMTP active (email rate limit 30/h).
   Still Mo-side later: "Confirm email" toggle at public launch; DMARC record for
   deliverability; Apple Services ID if Google/Apple sign-in ships at launch.

## Environment notes
- Dev machine: Windows + PowerShell, Node v24.15.0. Local repo `C:\Users\mohag\spotr`.
- Don't assume libraries are installed — check `package.json`. `@dnd-kit` is used (drag-drop reorder).
